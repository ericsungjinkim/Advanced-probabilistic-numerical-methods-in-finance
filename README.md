Final year at Ecole polytechnique course / Master Laure ELIE

In this project, we will be trying to solve numerically the system of decoupled forward and backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) in light of the intriguing method of deep neural networks applied on the backward stochastic differential equations reformulation of the desired semi-linear parabolic PDEs (deep BSDE developed in [1]). Then we will discuss the generalized case in which the FSDE and BSDE are coupled as in [2].
